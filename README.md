# Multiplayer Online Chess


https://multiplayer-chess-qh1o.onrender.com/

- link above to test multiplayer demo, open in two tabs to play against yourself, as it is hosted on the free tier of render, the server may take 30 seconds or so to boot up
- both tabs/players need to be logged in before the first move, otherwise the game will be out of sync (planning to fix this)
- hosted on render with a node.js backend and express server
- multiplayer communication using socket.io
- game is made in vanilla JS using ES6 classes, HTML canvas, JS doc, Jest (unit testing), Playwright and ES Modules (import/export)
- I built this myself with no tutorials as i wanted to focus on making my own design decisions
- I originally starting making this as my final project for Harvard's CS50 course but i decided to keep adding to it to try pushing the complexity
- I focused on OOP as I wanted to make the code modular and chose to focus on readability over performance where I could
- Chose to lean on the side of "over commenting" just so I can keep track of my arcitechture decsions
- I have refactored this project a few times as I learnt more
- had multiple code reviews with a senior dev friend and implemented their recommendations
